<h1> Tree Data Structure</h1>
<p>Root:The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierachy. In other words, the root npde is the one that doesn't have any parent. 
In the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If a node directly linked to some other node, it would be called a prent-child relationship.
Child node: if the node is a decendent of any node, then the node is known as a child node.
Parent:If the node cantains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node.
Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.</p>
